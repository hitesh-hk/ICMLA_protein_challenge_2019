                               Running tests
==============================================================================

cd to the appropriate machine directory (for example):

	cd $CNS_SOLVE/sgi-r8k10k-irix-6.5/test

to setup the appropriate links in the directory:

	run_tests -link

to run all the tests:

	run_tests *.inp

to calculate differences to the reference output files: 

	run_diffs *.inp

files will be created with any differences.

Note: the confdbtest.inp test file require library files
(libraries/confdb) which are not distributed with the CNS installation
(due to their size). These files can be obtained via the HTML
interface if necessary.
